YULC provides two ways to fuel your LED creations. Choose from the USB-C port supporting PD protocol (5V, 9V, 12V, 15V, and 20V) for up to 100W (5A@20V), or use a separate power supply via the barrel jack (up to 20A@24V).

YULC empowers you to choose how your strips receive power: route the input power straight to the strips for maximum efficiency or tilize the built-in converter to deliver safe 5V or 12V to your strips, with a maximum of 20A. Simply populate one of the two fuse holders to select your preference.
